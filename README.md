Predicting property prices in Gurgaon, like any real estate prediction, involves analyzing a variety of factors that influence the market.
1. Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data on historical property prices in Gurgaon. This includes details such as property location, size, amenities, age, transaction dates, and selling prices.

2. Feature Selection:Identify key features that significantly affect property prices in Gurgaon. These may include:
   - Location factors (proximity to commercial hubs, transportation, schools, etc.)
   - Property characteristics (size, number of bedrooms, amenities)
   - Economic indicators (local GDP growth, employment rates)
   - Market trends (supply and demand dynamics, interest rates)

3. Data Preprocessing:Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency. This step may involve normalization or scaling of numerical features.

4. Feature Engineering: Create additional relevant features from the existing dataset. For example:
   - Distance to the nearest metro station or business district
   - Age of the property
   - Price per square foot/meter

5. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for prediction. Common models for property price prediction include:
   - Linear regression
   - Decision trees and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Neural networks for more complex patterns

6. Training and Evaluation:Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

7. Model Tuning: Fine-tune the model hyperparameters to improve performance. Techniques like cross-validation can be used for this purpose.

8. Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict property prices for new data based on the selected features.

9. Monitoring and Updating: Real estate markets can be volatile, so itâ€™s essential to monitor model performance over time and update it with new data periodically to ensure predictions remain accurate.
